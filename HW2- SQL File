INSTRUCTIONS:

GOAL: Calculate the batting average using SQL queries for every player

 1. Start with one player
 		Do Annual
 		Do Historic
 		Rolling (over last 100 days) ? - Look at the last 100 days that player was in prior to this game
 2. Apply above to all players
   Store all these results in their own tables
