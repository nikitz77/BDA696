INSTRUCTIONS:

GOAL: Calculate the batting average using SQL queries for every player

 1. Start with one player
 		Do Annual
 		Do Historic
 		Rolling (over last 100 days) ? - Look at the last 100 days that player was in prior to this game
 2. Apply above to all players
   Store all these results in their own tables
*/

-- This query pulls out the number of years that players played and gives me the batting average by year
-- Both Historic and Annual metrics are on the first query/table.
-- -- PLEASE NOTE: Zero''s were not taken out because you can be at bat and still strike out,
-- -- meaning a zero is possible for the time the player is at bat. z
